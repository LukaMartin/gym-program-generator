# Gym Program Gen

This application has been developed to allow users to easily create a gym program based on how many times they want to train per week and their goal.
The application will return a full training program with exercises, sets, reps and rest.
The "Exercise Instructions" page then allows users to look up any exercises they may not have come across to get a better understanding.

## Tech Stack

I have built this project using TypeScript, React, NextJs and Tailwind CSS for styling.
I have utilised the ChatGPT API, the openai API is queried and results are then displayed to the user.

## Future Development

I plan to continue to build on this going forwards. The features I would like to add include: 
- Exporting the training plan
- A new page for diet plans
- An exercise tracker
- Add local storage
